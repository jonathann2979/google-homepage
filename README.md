This was my first time actually creating something using HTML5 and CSS! It was quite confusing and difficult to be honest! Starting from scratch, the HTML seemed straight forward but the actual CSS is where I started to encounter difficulties. After extensive googling and referencing back to the freeCodeCamp lessons, I was able to come to somewhat of an understanding regarding how CSS Grid and Flexboxes worked! This was definitely a difficult yet seemingly simple project and I hope that I will be able to improve on developing my skills further to make projects like these a breeze in the future!
